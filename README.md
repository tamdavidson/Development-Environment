# Development-Environment
A development/testing/cyber-range environment. The intended end goal is to have an independent environment that can be used to test tools, tactics and procedures. The environment will include a range of diverse operating systems, applications and services that can be spun up and destroyed with a small amount of effort. The goal is to have a solution that will be consistent, reliable and repeatable.    

## To-do List
+ End-goal network diagram.
+ Current network diagram.
+ Terraform code to crate infra on esxi.
+ Packer code to create VMware images.
+ Create scripts using suitable solutions to install services and applications on images.
+ Add more to the to-do list.
